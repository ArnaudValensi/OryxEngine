Oryx Engine is a free/open source game engine. It is primarily being developed
to power my personal game projects, but maybe it'll prove useful for others.

At the moment it is being developed in Linux, though it should be portable to
the major 3 OS's with a little work (fixes and build scripts for Windows should
be up in the near future, and perhaps the same for OSX).

The engine provides a core with basic state management, an event system (heavily
inspired by Qt's signals/slots) and some other stuff (timer, logger, math/string 
utils, etc).

Functionality is added by extending the EngineSubsystem class. This way you
can use the same core with any number of different kinds of games and middleware.
At the moment I'm making a 3D game, so I'm actively developing an Ogre3D subsystem,
one for bullet physics, OpenAL, and Chaiscript. More will come later as I work
on different projects.
